# MultivariateRegressionInR

We use economic data from the Heritage Foundation to run a multivariate linear regression analysis on the data they provide. This analysis is then used to introduce additional concepts for evaluating multivariate regression.
The goal of our research is to see whether the indices are good predictors of economic prosperity of countries. So, we are interested to explore the data variables and see if they are predictive of at least one of the economic indicators that we have in our dataset - GDP growth, unemployment and etc.
